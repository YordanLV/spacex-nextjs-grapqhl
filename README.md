 ## Getting Started

 ```bash
yarn build
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Stack

- Next.js 
- Apollo with GraphQL (with SSR HoC implementation)
- Styled-components (for styling)
- Typescript

## Possible improvements

- Adding eslint / tslint (for better code maintenance).
- Adding global styles and variable with styled components. (createGlobalStyle)
- Material UI or a similiar UI library for easier and more consistent UI.
- With bigger code base I would most likely have all the types in the same place to have a better reusability.
- Would use GraphQL framgents for better GraphQL query managment.
